# <center>Brain Tumor Detection</center>

## Overview:
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be either non-cancerous or cancerous. These tumors may originate within the brain or spread from other parts of the body. They can disrupt normal brain functions, leading to symptoms such as headaches, seizures, cognitive impairments, and motor deficits. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination, depending on the tumor type, location, and stage. Therefore Early detection is crucial for effective management.

Types of Brain Tumors We've taken for Detection:
* Pituatory Tumor
* Glioma Tumor
* Meningioma Tumor
